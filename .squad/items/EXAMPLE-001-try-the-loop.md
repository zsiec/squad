## Problem

You just ran `squad init` (or `squad go`, which calls init for you). This item
exists so you can practice the loop without any real work at stake. Walk through
it once and you'll know how the system fits together.

If you got here via `squad go`, you already hold the claim — skip the first AC
step. If you ran `squad init` standalone, claim it yourself.

## Context

The loop is: claim → work → done. Every command is greppable from
`squad --help`. The item file you're reading right now is the durable
contract; the SQLite-backed claim is the live lock.

`squad thinking` is one of squad's chat verbs — short typed messages stored
durably so future sessions can read them. Other verbs: `ask`, `say`, `fyi`,
`milestone`, `stuck`. See `docs/concepts/chat-cadence.md` for the full set.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Hold the claim. Either `squad go` already claimed this for you, or run
      `squad claim EXAMPLE-001 --intent "trying the loop"` yourself.
- [ ] Confirm your identity: `squad whoami`.
- [ ] Post a thought: `squad thinking "first squad loop"`.
- [ ] Mark done with a one-line outcome: `squad done EXAMPLE-001 --summary "loop works"`.
- [ ] Verify the file moved to `.squad/done/`.
- [ ] Delete this file (it's served its purpose).

## Resolution

(Fill in after you close it. Then delete the file.)
