# Evidence requirement

A claim is not done because you are confident it is done. A claim is done when the verification artifact for that claim exists in the conversation, in machine-readable form, that anyone reading later could re-run themselves.

## When to use this skill

Invoke this skill any time you are about to write the words "tests pass," "build is clean," "this works," "looks good," or any equivalent. Also invoke before running `squad done` or `/done`. The pre-flight check for `done` is whether the evidence pastes are present.

## The rule

Two artifacts per verification, not one:

1. **Attest** the run via `squad attest`. The binary executes the `--command` itself, captures stdout+stderr, hashes the result, and writes it under `.squad/attestations/`. The attestation is the durable record `squad done` reads to verify the gate.
2. **Paste** the trailing output line into the conversation, in a code block, directly under the command. Do not paraphrase. Do not summarize. Do not say "tests pass" — paste the line that proves it. The paste is for the humans and agents reading the thread now.

Concrete shape:

```bash
squad attest <ITEM-ID> --kind test --command "go test ./..."
```

`squad attest` runs the command, captures the output, and stores it. Read the captured output (or re-read it from the printed attestation path) and paste the trailing `ok` line into chat. One invocation, both artifacts.

Concretely:

- **Test runner (Go, Node, Python, Rust, etc.):** include the trailing `ok` / `PASS` / `passed` summary line. If many packages, summarize as `ok: N/M packages, <duration>` plus any FAIL block verbatim.
- **Type checker:** include the trailing `<N> errors, <N> warnings` line.
- **Linter / formatter:** silent success or the actual error output. No paraphrasing.
- **Build:** silent success or the actual error output.
- **Manual verification (browser, CLI smoke test, integration):** explicitly state what you observed in concrete terms. Generic statements like "works as expected" do not count.
- **Skipped a gate?** Say so and why ("no UI changes, skipping vitest"). Silence reads as omission.

## Why this matters

The next session reading your conversation cannot distinguish "I ran the tests and they passed" from "I think they would pass if I ran them" unless you paste the output. Without the paste, your "done" is unverifiable. Unverifiable "done" rots the team's trust in the backlog: future agents start re-running everything to be sure, which doubles wall-clock per item and defeats the point of the close-out.

The paste is also a forcing function on you. If you cannot paste a green line, you have not actually verified — you have rationalized. Catch yourself in the rationalization before it ships.

## How to apply

1. Run the verification through `squad attest <ITEM-ID> --kind <kind> --command "..."`. The binary executes the command and writes captured output into the durable ledger.
2. Read the captured output. Find the line that summarizes the result.
3. Paste that line, in a code block, into the conversation directly under the attest invocation that produced it.
4. If the line is buried in noise, paste the noise too — others may need it for diagnosis.
5. If the command failed, paste the failure block verbatim and stop. Do not move on.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- "All tests pass" with no paste. Cannot be verified.
- "Should pass" / "would pass." Either it passed or you did not run it.
- Pasting a green line for a different command than the one you claim to have run. Match the paste to the claim.
- Pasting a stale paste from earlier in the session as if it were the latest run. Re-run; paste the latest.
- Skipping the paste because "the commit hook would have caught it." The commit hook runs after you claim done, not before; the order matters.
- Skipping the attestation. The paste lives in the chat transcript; without `squad attest` the durable ledger stays empty and `squad done` cannot verify the gate. Both artifacts, every time.

## What kinds to record

`squad attest --kind <kind>` accepts a few standard kinds. Pick the one that matches the run:

- **`--kind test`** — any unit / integration / e2e command. `go test`, `pytest`, `vitest`, `cargo test`, `npm test`. Mandatory for `bug` / `feature` / `task` items; the per-item `evidence_required: [test]` field gates `squad done` on at least one attestation of this kind.
- **`--kind review`** — a reviewer-agent run. Typically captured by reviewer agents themselves per `squad-reviewing-as-disprove`; the output is the reviewer's findings document or transcript.
- **`--kind manual`** — manual verification. Browser smoke test, CLI demo, "I clicked through and the modal opened." Write your observations to a file, then attest by pointing `--command` at a printer that emits them, e.g.:

  ```bash
  cat > /tmp/manual-notes.txt <<EOF
  clicked the Refine button in the inbox modal — composer opened inline,
  typed feedback, submitted; item flipped from inbox to needs-refinement
  and SSE pushed inbox_changed within 100ms.
  EOF

  squad attest <ITEM-ID> --kind manual --command "cat /tmp/manual-notes.txt"
  ```

  The `--command` output (your description) is what gets hashed into the ledger. Generic notes like "works as expected" do not count.
