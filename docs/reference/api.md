# HTTP API

Reference for the JSON endpoints exposed by `squad serve` (and consumed by the SPA, the TUI, and any custom integrations). All routes are mounted under `/api/`. Live updates ride a Server-Sent Events stream at `/api/events`.

> **Need a typed client?** The Go HTTP+SSE client lives at `internal/tui/client/`. CLI users should reach for `squad <verb>` (see [commands.md](commands.md)) — the API is the integration surface, not the day-to-day UX.

## Conventions

- **Transport:** plain HTTP/1.1, JSON request/response bodies.
- **Auth:** loopback only by default. Bind address is `127.0.0.1` unless explicitly overridden.
- **Status codes:** `200` on success, `404` when a named subject is missing, `500` for internal errors. The error body is always `{"error":"<message>"}`.
- **Empty lists:** list endpoints always return `[]`, never `null`, even when nothing matches.
- **Walkers swallow malformed-file errors:** parser errors on individual on-disk files are skipped silently — a typo in one spec file does not 500 the whole list. Outright IO failure on the parent directory still 500s.

## Specs

### `GET /api/specs`

List all specs parsed from `.squad/specs/`.

**Query parameters:** none.

**Response:** array of summary rows.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "sample-spec",
    "title": "Sample spec for server tests",
    "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/specs/sample-spec.md"
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/specs/{name}`

Full detail for a single spec, keyed by slug (`name`).

**Path parameters:**
- `name` — spec slug (the filename minus `.md`).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "name": "sample-spec",
  "title": "Sample spec for server tests",
  "motivation": "Server tests need a real spec on disk to walk",
  "acceptance": ["GET /api/specs returns this spec", "GET /api/specs/sample-spec returns full body"],
  "non_goals": ["Production scenarios"],
  "integration": ["Used by internal/server tests only"],
  "body_markdown": "# Sample spec\n\nThis is a sample spec body...",
  "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/specs/sample-spec.md"
}
```

`acceptance`, `non_goals`, and `integration` are always arrays (empty when the frontmatter list is missing).

**Errors:** `404` when no spec matches `{name}`.

## Epics

### `GET /api/epics`

List all epics parsed from `.squad/epics/`.

**Query parameters:**
- `spec` (optional) — restrict to epics whose `spec:` frontmatter equals this slug.

**Response:** array of summary rows.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "sample-epic",
    "spec": "sample-spec",
    "status": "open",
    "parallelism": "low",
    "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/epics/sample-epic.md"
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/epics/{name}`

Full detail for a single epic.

**Path parameters:**
- `name` — epic slug.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "name": "sample-epic",
  "spec": "sample-spec",
  "status": "open",
  "parallelism": "low",
  "body_markdown": "# Sample epic\n\nSample epic body for tests.\n",
  "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/epics/sample-epic.md"
}
```

**Errors:** `404` when no epic matches `{name}`.

## Attestations

### `GET /api/items/{id}/attestations`

The evidence ledger for an item: every recorded `squad attest` row, oldest first. Both successful and failed attestations are returned (`exit_code` distinguishes them).

**Path parameters:**
- `id` — item id (e.g. `BUG-100`, `FEAT-007`).

**Response:** array of ledger rows.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 42,
    "kind": "test",
    "command": "go test ./...",
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output_hash": "sha256-hex",
    "output_path": ".squad/attestations/sha256-hex.txt",
    "created_at": 1714134000,
    "agent_id": "agent-blue"
  }
]
```

`kind` is one of `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, `review`, `manual`. `created_at` is Unix seconds. The endpoint returns `[]` for an item with no attestations (rather than 404) — non-existence of the item is indistinguishable from "no evidence yet" by design.

## Learnings

### `GET /api/learnings`

List learning artifacts walked from the configured learnings root (`.squad/learnings/`).

**Query parameters (all optional, applied as conjunctive filters):**
- `state` — one of `proposed`, `approved`, `rejected`.
- `kind` — one of `actions`, `patterns`, `nots`, `gotchas`.
- `area` — exact-match filter against the learning's `area:` frontmatter.

**Response:** array of summary rows.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "GOTCHA-001",
    "kind": "gotcha",
    "slug": "sample-gotcha",
    "title": "Sample gotcha for server tests",
    "area": "server",
    "state": "approved",
    "created": "2026-04-26",
    "created_by": "agent-test",
    "paths": ["internal/server/**"],
    "related_items": ["BUG-100"]
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/learnings/{slug}`

Full detail for a single learning, including body and evidence.

**Path parameters:**
- `slug` — the learning's directory name under its kind/state pair.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "GOTCHA-001",
  "kind": "gotcha",
  "slug": "sample-gotcha",
  "title": "Sample gotcha for server tests",
  "area": "server",
  "state": "approved",
  "created": "2026-04-26",
  "created_by": "agent-test",
  "session": "test-session",
  "paths": ["internal/server/**"],
  "evidence": ["tests pass"],
  "related_items": ["BUG-100"],
  "body_markdown": "# Sample gotcha\n\n## Looks like\n...",
  "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/learnings/gotchas/approved/sample-gotcha.md"
}
```

`paths`, `evidence`, and `related_items` are always arrays. `session` may be empty when the proposal didn't capture one.

**Errors:** `404` when no learning matches `{slug}` in any kind/state combination.

## SSE events

`GET /api/events` opens a Server-Sent Events stream. Each frame has the shape:

```text
event: <kind>
data: {"kind":"<kind>","payload":{...}}

```

Subscribers should match on the `event:` line. Comment-only `: ping` heartbeats arrive at the configured ping interval to keep proxies from idle-closing the connection. A `lag` event is emitted when the server-side bus has dropped events for this subscriber; its `payload.dropped` is the count.

The two events landed in the round that introduced specs/epics/learnings/attestations endpoints:

### `attestation_recorded`

Fires immediately after a successful `Insert` on the attestation ledger when the ledger is wired to the server's bus (i.e. publishes from server-mediated paths; CLI inserts via `squad attest` skip the publish because they don't share the bus). Re-inserts that hit the ledger's unique constraint and return the existing row do **not** re-publish.

**Payload:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `item_id` | string | The item the attestation is scoped to. |
| `kind` | string | One of `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, `review`, `manual`. |
| `id` | int64 | The new ledger row id. |
| `created_at` | int64 | Unix seconds when the row was written. |

```json
{
  "kind": "attestation_recorded",
  "payload": {"item_id": "BUG-100", "kind": "test", "id": 42, "created_at": 1714134000}
}
```

### `learning_state_changed`

Fires after `learning.Promote` successfully renames a learning between state directories (`proposed` ↔ `approved` ↔ `rejected`). Server-side promotions (the SPA / dashboard pathway) publish; CLI promotions via `squad learning approve` / `reject` pass `nil` for the bus and skip the publish.

**Payload:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string | The learning's slug. |
| `kind` | string | `actions` / `patterns` / `nots` / `gotchas`. |
| `from_state` | string | The state the learning was in before the move. |
| `to_state` | string | The state directory it now lives in. |
| `path` | string | Absolute path of the destination file. |

```json
{
  "kind": "learning_state_changed",
  "payload": {
    "slug": "sample-gotcha",
    "kind": "gotcha",
    "from_state": "proposed",
    "to_state": "approved",
    "path": "/abs/path/to/.squad/learnings/gotchas/approved/sample-gotcha.md"
  }
}
```
