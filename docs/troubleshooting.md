# Troubleshooting

Each entry is **symptom → cause → fix.**

## Stale claim blocks me from claiming

**Symptom:** `squad claim FEAT-001` exits with "already claimed by agent-blue" but agent-blue hasn't been online for hours.

**Cause:** agent-blue's session died without releasing. The claim is still live in the DB.

**Fix:**

```bash
squad doctor                                              # confirms the claim is stale
squad ask @agent-blue "stealing FEAT-001, ok?"            # courtesy ping
squad force-release FEAT-001 --reason "agent-blue offline >2h"
squad claim FEAT-001 --intent "..."
```

If agent-blue isn't reachable, skip the `ask` and proceed.

## Plugin not loading in Claude Code

**Symptom:** `/work`, `/pick`, etc. don't autocomplete in Claude Code.

**Cause:** Plugin directory absent or stale, or Claude Code wasn't restarted after install.

**Fix:**

```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/squad/                      # should list plugin.json + skills/ + commands/
squad install-plugin                             # re-installs idempotently
# Restart Claude Code
```

## Hook not firing

**Symptom:** SessionStart doesn't auto-register, or pre-commit-pm-traces doesn't block PM-trace commits.

**Cause:** `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks block missing or malformed.

**Fix:**

```bash
squad install-hooks --status                     # what's actually installed
squad install-hooks --yes                        # re-installs the defaults
# Inspect manually:
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq .hooks
```

If a hook is in settings.json but still doesn't fire, the script at `~/.squad/hooks/<name>.sh` might be missing or non-executable:

```bash
ls -la ~/.squad/hooks/                           # all five .sh files, executable
squad install-hooks --yes                        # re-materializes the scripts
```

## DB integrity error

**Symptom:** Any squad command exits with a SQLite error mentioning corruption or WAL replay.

**Cause:** Disk filled up mid-write, or the process was killed during a transaction.

**Fix:**

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.squad/global.db "PRAGMA integrity_check"
# If "ok", you're done. If not, recover:
mv ~/.squad/global.db ~/.squad/global.db.broken
sqlite3 ~/.squad/global.db.broken ".recover" | sqlite3 ~/.squad/global.db
```

The `.recover` path reconstructs as much as SQLite can. Operational state is machine-local; you'll lose any unrecoverable rows but not item content (that's in git).

## settings.json got mangled

**Symptom:** `squad install-hooks` or Claude Code reports JSON parse errors on `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Cause:** Manual edit collided with squad's atomic write, or a non-squad tool wrote bad JSON.

**Fix:** Squad writes to `~/.claude/settings.json.tmp` then renames atomically. If the rename succeeded but the source was bad, restore from a backup:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/settings.json*                      # any .bak files?
# Or rewrite from scratch:
echo '{}' > ~/.claude/settings.json
squad install-hooks --yes                        # rewrites from squad's side
# Then re-add any non-squad hooks you had.
```

## `squad init` refuses to run

**Symptom:** `squad init` exits with "managed block markers in unexpected state."

**Cause:** A previous run was interrupted, or you manually edited the markers in CLAUDE.md.

**Fix:** Open CLAUDE.md and find the squad-managed markers:

```markdown
<!-- squad-managed:start -->
...
<!-- squad-managed:end -->
```

Make sure exactly one start and one end exist, in that order. Delete the entire block (markers included) if you want a clean re-init, then re-run `squad init`.

## `squad init` says "not a git repository"

**Symptom:** `squad init` exits with `detect repo: not a git repository: <git stderr>`.

**Cause:** Squad uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to derive a stable repo identity. Without git, the directory path would be the only fallback — which is unstable across moves and clones.

**Fix:** Initialize the repository first.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
squad init
```

If you genuinely want squad in a non-git directory (rare), the answer is to make it a git repo. There is no `--no-git` mode, by design.

## `squad done` fails with "evidence_required not satisfied"

**Symptom:**

```text
FEAT-001: evidence_required not satisfied. Missing kinds: test, review.
Run squad attest --item FEAT-001 --kind <kind> --command "..." for each, or pass --force.
```

**Cause:** The item's frontmatter has `evidence_required: [test, review]` (or similar), and you haven't recorded an attestation for each kind. Squad refuses to close out without the evidence — the whole point of the ledger is that "the agent said it's done" isn't sufficient.

**Fix:** Run the verifications squad is asking for, capturing each into the ledger.

```bash
# kind=test|lint|typecheck|build — squad runs the command and stores stdout+exit.
squad attest --item FEAT-001 --kind test --command "go test ./..."

# kind=review — write your findings to a file first; squad reads and stores it.
echo "approved: tests green, no regressions" > /tmp/review.md
squad attest --item FEAT-001 --kind review \
    --reviewer-agent agent-helper --findings-file /tmp/review.md

squad done FEAT-001 --summary "..."
```

If the verification genuinely doesn't apply (the item was wrongly tagged, or the failure is a flake you've ruled out), use `--force`:

```bash
squad done FEAT-001 --summary "..." --force
```

This records a manual attestation logging the override; the audit trail is preserved.

To set up `evidence_required` on an item you're filing, add it to the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: FEAT-001
evidence_required: [test, review]
---
```

See [reference/commands.md#squad-attest](reference/commands.md#squad-attest) for the full attestation flow.

## Touch warnings won't go away

**Symptom:** `squad touch` keeps warning about a peer's touch even though the peer says they're done.

**Cause:** Peer didn't run `squad untouch` (or the corresponding `squad done` / `squad release`).

**Fix:**

```bash
squad doctor                                     # lists orphan touches with the suggested squad untouch <path> command
```

Doctor flags orphan touches with a `Fix:` recommendation; you decide whether to follow it. If a touch is still attached to an active claim that itself has gone stale, the upstream stale claim is the real issue; force-release per "Stale claim" above and the orphan disappears.

## Workspace next ignores a repo

**Symptom:** `squad workspace next` doesn't show items from a repo you know exists.

**Cause:** Repo not registered in the global DB. Registration is lazy — happens when any squad command runs in that repo.

**Fix:**

```bash
cd /path/to/the/repo && squad next
# Now the repo is registered; back wherever you were:
squad workspace list                             # confirm it's listed now
```

If it still doesn't appear, the repo_id might be different from what you expect. Check:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.squad/global.db "SELECT id, root_path, name FROM repos"
```

## Web UI not updating

**Symptom:** `squad serve` dashboard goes stale; new claims/messages don't appear.

**Cause:** SSE connection dropped (browser tab backgrounded, network hiccup).

**Fix:** Reload the tab. The dashboard reconnects on page load.

If the server itself died, restart `squad serve`. Logs go to stderr; if it's exiting on startup, check for port conflicts.

## When all else fails

Capture the diagnostics and file an issue:

```bash
squad version
squad doctor
go env | head -10
sw_vers 2>/dev/null || lsb_release -a 2>/dev/null    # OS info
```
