# Contributing

Squad uses squad. If you contribute, you'll work the same loop the docs describe.

## Setup (one-time)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsiec/squad
cd squad
go build ./cmd/squad                                # confirms the build works
go test -race ./...                                 # confirms tests pass

# scaffold a .squad/ if this clone doesn't have one yet, then onboard
./squad go                                          # idempotent: init + register + claim + AC + mailbox
```

Optional: install the plugin and hooks against this repo (and yes, you can dogfood squad on squad).

```bash
./squad install-plugin
./squad install-hooks --yes
```

## Pick something to work on

```bash
./squad next                            # top of the ready stack
./squad workspace next                  # cross-repo if you've got more
ls .squad/items/                        # browse manually
```

Or file something:

```bash
./squad new bug "race in the cache flusher"
./squad new feat "expose --json on whoami"
./squad new chore "ItemPath helper missing for cmd/squad/done.go"
# (DEBT, INFRA, etc. work too — add the prefix to .squad/config.yaml first.)
```

## Work the loop

```bash
./squad claim BUG-042 --intent "stop the leak; add regression test"
# ... read AC end-to-end ...
# ... if AC names a concrete failure, write the RED test FIRST against current code ...
# ... minimum impl ...
go test -race ./...
golangci-lint run                       # CI runs this; you should too locally

./squad milestone "AC 1 green"
./squad review-request BUG-042
# ... spawn superpowers:code-reviewer with the diff ...
# ... address findings ...
./squad done BUG-042 --summary "leak fixed; regression test green"

git add .squad/ <the actual files>
git commit -m "fix: stop the cache leak"
```

## Conventions

- **Commits:** prefixes `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`. Subject ≤72 chars, lowercase after the prefix, imperative mood. Body explains WHY. **No `Co-Authored-By` lines.**
- **No PM-trace IDs in code.** Item IDs go in filenames under `.squad/items/`, not in identifiers, comments, or commit messages.
- **Comments:** default to none. Only keep a comment if removing it would confuse a future reader.
- **No future-work TODO comments.** File an item instead.
- **Pure Go, no CGO.** `CGO_ENABLED=0` for every supported os/arch.
- **TDD by default.** Failing test → minimal impl → passing test → commit. Skip only for pure refactors with full coverage.

The full convention list lives in [the repo's CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Submit a PR

```bash
git checkout -b fix-cache-leak           # branch name doesn't carry the item ID
git push -u origin fix-cache-leak

# Embed the squad-item marker in the PR body so the auto-archive workflow runs:
./squad pr-link BUG-042 > /tmp/marker.txt
gh pr create \
  --title "fix: stop the cache leak" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF
## Summary

Replaced the broken handler with a less-broken handler.

## Test plan

- [x] go test -race ./...
- [x] golangci-lint run

$(cat /tmp/marker.txt)
EOF
)"
```

CI runs on push: `go test -race ./...`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, build for all four os/arch combos. Get a green run before requesting review.

When the PR merges, the [auto-archive workflow](recipes/github-actions.md) reads the marker and moves the item to `.squad/done/` with a generic commit message — so the merge commit on main stays free of PM IDs.

## Releases

`main` is always shippable. Maintainer cuts a `vX.Y.Z` tag; goreleaser builds and publishes binaries. Homebrew tap PR is auto-opened.

## Scope

- **v1**: the binary, plugin, hooks, multi-repo, GitHub Actions integration, evidence ledger, statistics, agent-teams interop docs, full reference docs.
- **v1.1**: more hooks, web UI auth, additional importers.
- **v2**: cross-machine global.db sync, REST API, more integrations.

The current state of v1 lives in `.squad/items/` of this repo.

## The no-telemetry pledge

Squad will never phone home. No usage stats, no crash reports, no "anonymous" anything. Telemetry PRs are closed without merge. Adoption is measured externally (stars, Homebrew counts) — not by spying on users.

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Disagree on code, not on people. Maintainers reserve the right to remove anyone making it less fun.
